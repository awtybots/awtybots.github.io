## Website details
The Awtybots website uses the Bootstrap CSS framework (Bootstrap  v5.3.2) for HTML formatting, as it is based on a Bootstrap template. See the [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/) for specifics on how to edit the style and functionality of the Bootstrap framework.
In order to edit the content of a page, you modify the .html file corresponding to that page. To add a new page, you should copy one of the .html files and modify it so that it has the contents you want, and then add a link to that page on some other page so that visitors to the website may access the page. If you want to modify a component of the website common to all pages (such as the website header or footer), you need to modify it in the same way for all exising pages (this is probably a fixable issue, though).
