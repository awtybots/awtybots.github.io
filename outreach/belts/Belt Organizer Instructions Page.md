# Belt Organizer Instructions

Why: We had this idea to organize all of our belts because they were getting out of control.

What (Research): We looked around for some ideas and discovered 3005’s belt holders. We decided to use the laser cutter machine, as the wood that is cut is more sustainable and suitable for everyday use than, for example, filament. The belt organizers are held by hooks to make them accessible and easy to find.

How (Modifications/Experimentation Phase): We decided to CAD our own version of belt organizers specifically for HTD belts, as we use those the most, and 3005’s was made for only GT2 belts. We also added a tab on the end to ensure the belts do not slide off.

Instructions: Take our model CAD for a 160T 9mm Belt, and look at this data table to decide the length.   
When you change this dimension:

to the (OG length \- 0.5), then you can change the width per the number of belts you have. As a general rule, 10 belts fit on roughly 4 inches total of space, which would be this dimension here:

We have provided the width of each type of HTD belt so you can modify it to whatever you require. Also, you may have to adjust the text size when you change the width. We used roughly 2.5x .3 rectangle of text centered between the two top slots, but feel free to change this or the font based on your team’s aesthetic.

Laser Cutting: When you begin laser cutting, right click on the object to export as a DWG or DXF file to Adobe Illustrator.

Make sure the file stays the original size when exported.

Then, zoom in to roughly 100% and highlight the text and group it.

Then, hide it from view and zoom out.

Change the stroke of the remaining lines to 0.001pt.

Unhide the text.

Now you are ready to print\! Click File → Print and select Epilog engraver.

Finally, when selecting the printer settings, we recommend using the Clipart Text Engraving 500 DPI under wood for the engraved text, and Cutting ⅛” (3mm) or ¼” (6mm) under wood for the overall cutout.

You are free to choose a different material; we recommend wood since it is the cheapest and most sustainable option. Then click print, and you are all set\! Don’t forget to autofocus if you switch between multiple sizes of wood\!

Implementation: Put the belts on; they should slide through the 2nd to the top notch and curl around the bottom, stopping at the tab. Use hooks like these or these. We have linked the magnetic ones and the non-magnetic ones, and loop them through the top cutout.
