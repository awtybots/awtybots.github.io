# 24 Days Until McAllen

Today was the last day of our winter break and it was a shorter meeting due to the teacher in service but we still got a lot of work done.

# Twindexer

- We made some changes to fix some deadzones and we saw some improvements. We trimmed down the flanges of our divider and added an additional 3D printed part to connect the wall of the shooter and twindexer together to remove a potential jamming spot. There are still some compression things we want to look at and adjust but this system is ready to go to the competition robot.

# Shooter

- The shooter remained unchanged as we currently like how it’s performing. We did add a 3:1 reduction to the kicker motor and that solved some jamming issues we saw. Next steps will be to remove more and more deadzones so that the shooter can empty a full hopper with no issues. 

# Climber

- We climbed today successfully and got completely off the ground with the new adjustments to the tubes. Our max height of the climber when fully extended is 29 inches so we might want to increase that to get to 30. The downside is when it’s fully retracted, it is 22.75 inches which puts us over the limit to get under the trench. We’ll look at geometry numbers and adjust but we are satisfied with the results from today.

# Intake

- The 4-bar intake did not work like we wanted it to so we are scrapping that idea. Right now we are working on a linear intake and a slapdown. We have a deadline of when both need to be completed so we can assemble it and get it on the practice robot. It’s the last system that needs attention. 

# Competition Robot Progress \- 25% to completion

- The comp robot drive base was assembled today. We only want to assemble parts and systems once we know they will not change so we don’t have to undo anything on the competition robot. The goal will be to get it to 100% completion by the end of this week. It’s a tough goal to achieve but we will push ourselves to reach it.
