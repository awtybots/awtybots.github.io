# Weekly Mandatory Meetings Increase

- Active Members: 2 -> 3 Mandatory meetings per week
- Leadership Members: 3 -> 3 Mandatory meetings per week

# 23/24 \- 95.8%

That’s the accuracy of the shooter in our last shot today. Granted we only ran 1 side of the shooter due to some issues with the spindexer and jamming (more on this later) but this was very good for our first real subsystem combined test. We wanted to run these together to get an idea of whether there were any more areas of work that needed to be addressed with some subsystems.

# Shooter

- The shooter got mounted back on but we did have to cut up our divider to get it on. The mounting holes for the divider were missing and this led to some issues with the shooter also not being fully secure and bouncing up when shooting.

- The other issue we found is the kicker motors aren’t strong enough and can get jammed easily with a full hopper. So we think we’ll need to add some gearboxes to them to give them more torque to help with that issue. 

# Twindexer

- This was a pain point in our shooting today but surprisingly, when we switched to just shooting on one side, it worked very well. For some reason, the right side of the shooter and twindexer didn’t jam as much as the left side so we set the motors to feed the balls that direction and we shot 23/24 with less jamming issues. The balls get jammed at the divider we have and at where the lexan plates of the shooter and spindexer walls meet so we need to address those areas to reduce that compression/friction in order to help the fuel flow more easily.

# Intake

- Intake got reassembled again but it doesn’t look promising. We are thinking of ditching the 4-bar intake and just switching to a slapdown just for simplicity and getting a working intake on the robot. Hopefully we can get this worked out quickly as it’s the only system that’s not been tested.

We did a lot of work on this winter break but we didn’t reach our goal of finishing the practice robot. We did cut out the drive frame for the competition robot and started to paint those so the drive base can be assembled starting next week for the competition robot. Our first event is less than a month away so the pressure is starting to rise.
