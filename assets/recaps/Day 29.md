The goal of shooting was not met but for good reason. We spent the majority of the day working on electrical and going over some “pain” points found once we started putting things together.
Motors, motors and more motors
22 motors. That’s the most we’ve ever had on a robot. Big problem though, the PDH only has slots for 20 and one of those slots, we need for the mini power module for the cameras we want to mount. That leaves us with only 19 ports for motors. This will be a challenge as to where we can cut motors. We already have some ideas like cutting 1 from the shooter and 2 from the intake but we will want to see what that looks like and how it works.

# Shooter

- When we mounted the shooter with the twindexer, we noticed an opening between the two that might be problematic. Today in the little testing we did, our thoughts were right. We will want to make some changes and adjustments to ensure that we fix that before we start ramping up testing.

# Intake

- The intake was finally finished today but before we looked to mount it on the robot, we found a key issue that forced us to make a change. The powered bottom roller can’t work due to the belt path. When the intake is stowed, the pulley is on one side of the shaft, and when it’s extended, the belt has to be on the other side. Meaning the belt would have to “phase” through the shaft in order for it to work. That’s not possible so we had to remove the belt for now. With how the intake has a 4 motor system, redesigning the intake is an option, but for now, we want to see if we can make some minor adjustments with the motors to see if it will still work like we want it too.

# Hopper

- The hopper was cut and semi assembled today. We will put it on once we get everything wired up and connected.

# Electrical

- Electrical was hard at work today wiring up all the motors and running wire correctly on the brainpan. We got to the shooter and ran into some CAN issues but managed to run it a little before we left. We’ll finish up and address them on Monday so we can get the robot working.
Even though the robot didn’t do what we wanted it to do today, we still made progress and are looking forward to getting a lot of work done this week due to it being winter break. We should achieve a lot of our goals this week and get started on some good testing.
