Day 18
We were back on campus today and that means back to in person meetings. Yesterday, the CAD team did meet virtually with us having digital school. A lot of things were discussed and we actually ended up flipping the direction of the shooter to being away from the intake. It’s very possible we do switch back but we think this might be the better option right now
Part Order 1 of 4(?) Arrived
Our WCP part order of rollers and Cat Tongue tape arrived today, only for us to consider NOT doing the “hot dog” style rollers. CAD team has started running into some issues with packaging the roller system and also we are seeing some not so promising testing results with the rollers and intake. We decided to prototype the “twindexer” that 6328 has been testing on their YouTube today and it had some really good results. We aren’t sold yet on which we like, but we want to make a V2 of the twindexer tomorrow and see if that gives us better results.
The twindexer also solves a lot of our packaging issues we’re having with the hot dog roller, but the hot dog roller follows in line with our method of keeping things simple this season. We don’t want to lose any progress we’ve made and take steps back so we really need some huge improvements from the twindexer to make a final decision.
The shooter also got disassembled and started to be reassembled with new parts and the flipped orientation. We should be able to finish it tomorrow and hand it off to programming to get back to their PID tuning.
With the CAD deadline this week, things are starting to get a bit stressful, but that’s build season right?
