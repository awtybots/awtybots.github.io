# SHOOTER IS ALMOST DONE!!! 

The shooter is finally in it's final stages of
being finished. It has taken a lot of work to get here and as a team we
are so proud. We've worked soo hard all build season to get to this
point, it will be the biggest success in our team's history to get the
shooter done tomorrow.

All kidding aside, the shooter is only missing a few minor things to be
in working condition. We should be able to run it tomorrow and get back
to PID testing. We also hope we can run it with the spindexer soon so we
can see how the balls interact with the shooter and hopper combined.
That will give us valuable information about what tuning and tweaking we
will have to make before taking these subsystems to the competition
robot.

# Good news for the CAD team. 

We've extended the deadline for the CAD to
be finished by 1 more day. The CAD will need to be done by Feb. 1st
instead of tomorrow. The extra 24 hours should allow for some additional
work and clean up so that the final version can be, well, final.

Lastly, the results are in. The name of this year's robot is...

# Goldfire!!
