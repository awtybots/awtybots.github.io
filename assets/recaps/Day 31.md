First day of our winter break was a pretty big success. The robot got wired up and we were able to run the shooter-kicker-twindexer together and had some fun.

# Shooter

- We replaced the outside plates with new ones to fix the gap that the fuel was getting stuck in. After doing that, we found that they could get stuck between the motor and the edge of the shooter. We’ll probably cut the edge off but ideally we’ll want to create a cover over the motor so the balls don’t touch the motor and create any unnecessary friction. 
Twindexer
We haven’t touched this much since electrical was working on the robot. One of the motors is having some issues so we’ll look at the gearbox tomorrow. We also want to look at potentially just removing the gearbox altogether to increase the speed of the twindexer overall. We’ll probably start with fixing the gearbox first and see where that goes.


# Intake

- So the intake was changed to have the belt on the outside and the plate on the inside…but the same issue persisted. Not sure how we didn’t catch that but we ended up going back to having the plate on the outside and just removing the belt. We did get it mounted on the robot but not fully with the shafts. Our REV parts should be in tomorrow with the last piece we need to run the actuation of the intake so we’ll work on that as soon as it gets delivered. 

# Climber

- The climber was cut and the assembly started at the end of the meeting. Tomorrow, we should have some metal that we can cut on our water jet for the plates. Hopefully we can run the climber tomorrow and see how that works

The goal tomorrow will be to get the robot climbing and driving and shooting. We think this week will be big for us to accomplish a lot of these goals.
