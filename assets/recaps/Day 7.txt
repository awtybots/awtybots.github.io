Day 7
A lot of progress was made today. Both the hopper and shooter were worked on with the hopper getting to 80% done and the shooter getting to 99% (we forgot to put the gear on the shooter wheel). This sets us up to have a really productive day tomorrow when we have a lot of man power and longer hours. We are hoping to get the subsystems to work individually and then combine them together to work together. We’ll call this week a success if we can shoot 1 fuel.
Hopper
The hopper is not quite to spec but it does hold 50 fuel and stay under the 22.5 inch trench height. I’m curious if it can hold the fuel and go over the bump but we’ll have to test that out once the prototype gets cleaned up a bit. We are still unsure how the active part works with a few ideas still to discuss but this is based off of the Cranberry Alarm Ri3D and it should work pretty well right away.
Shooter
The shooter had a minor change today but this change allows us to have the subsystems work together in their prototype form. Initially, the fuel would travel in a “C” form but with how our hopper is designed, it would be shooting fuel into the side wall of the hopper. We switched to an “S” form so we can shoot away from the hopper. We are hoping to get similar results to what Cranberry Alarm has so we can start working on improvements. 
Climber
The climber is still being worked on but we are taking our attention away from it to focus on improving our other subsystems as the climber isn’t our priority. 
Programming
The programmers got their hands on the drive base today to hopefully start tuning auto PID. We did run into some issues with getting the radios set up so hopefully we can fix that quickly tomorrow and move forward. 
Goal tomorrow: SHOOT FUEL!!!!! 🙂
