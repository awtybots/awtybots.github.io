No pictures today as today was more about fixing than making progress.

# Intake

- We had to replace some plates on the intake to fix our initial issue with the phasing. That issue looks to be resolved so tomorrow, we hope to run the intake through some tests and see how it fairs.

# Climber

- Our initial cuts would not get us to the height we would need to climb so we had to recut some tubing. That set us back a bit as we were 90% of the way done before we realized that issue. Good news is our metal plate was water jet cut and while the tolerances are a bit off, we should be able to mount the climber and test it tomorrow.
