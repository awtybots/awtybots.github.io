DRIVE WORKS!!! Well sort of. The programming team worked today and finally got the drive moving. There are still some minor issues but at least they should (finally) be able to start working on auton routines and paths with some more tuning work.

# Shooter

- We started assembly of our hood-less shooter today. We believe this will be our final design and make it’s way to the competition robot after we start working on putting it with the twindexer and hopper.

# Twindexer

- We cut V3 today with some updated changes. Turns out .6 inch compression is too much so we are going to go back to .5 and also remove the rollers from the front of the opening. We plan to just cut the new version and mount it to the practice drive base so we can start working on the shooter and twindexer together.

# Intake

- Let’s all welcome the intake back to the recaps. Today we cut the plates to start building the 4-bar intake. We will try to start putting it together tomorrow alongside mounting the twindexer to the robot base.

Starting tomorrow, the practice robot should all start coming together and start looking like what we have in CAD. We still should be on track to meet our goal of a working practice robot this Saturday so let’s keep it going!
