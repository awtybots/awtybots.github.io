# Goal Shoot Fuel was successful!! 

All prototypes made significant
progress today. We didn't get them hooked up to one another but the
information we got from all of them was very important for us when we
meet to make our final design meeting.

# Shooter 

- Shooter didn't take long to get up and running. We noticed one
of the motors was a dead motor on the shooter itself so that did slow us
down in getting good testing on it. Once we swapped for a new one, we
started shooting. We also found that the angle of the hood was too high
as we were getting no arch on the shoots. Once we reduced it (not sure
to what angle exactly) we were able to reach the height we wanted at
only 55% power. We like the compression we were using but we still want
to try the other and see if it's better

# Hopper

- Initially, we had put the spindexer idea to the side and wanted to just
focus on the rollers but we figured we'd try to see how many balls it
can hold and how it can handle them. So we built out the spindexer into
a hopper and actually saw some promising results. We managed to empty
out about 45 balls in about 10 seconds. We think if we spend some time
on designing it and building it properly, we might get more consistent
and better results.

- As for the box hopper, unfortunately, the belts version just had too
many issues we were unable to solve to get accurate results. The intake
rollers showed great promise but don't think belts are the way to go
with the hopper. We will do some more thinking and research on it before
we call this idea quits.

# Programming 

- Programming worked on getting CAN IDs set for the motors and
started looking into shooter PID. We think that will help us get more
consistent shots so we can start tuning the shooter.

- Design deadline is Jan. 20th for us so the next 2 off days, we will be
doing a lot of thinking a researching Special shout out to our parents
for helping us build a Hub and a Bump today!!
