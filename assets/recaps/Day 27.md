All subsystems made a lot of progress. 

# Intake

- We ran into some issues with intake rollers not being cut right but we got those fixed and it did slow the progress down a bit. We are also building a 4-bar for the first time ever so that’s a challenge for us a bit. The motor plate is also a little tricky but we figured out the issue and plan to fix it tomorrow.
There isn’t much else to comment on because there was just a lot of building going on. We are on track to finish and reach our goal.
