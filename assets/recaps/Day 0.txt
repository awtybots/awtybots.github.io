‘Twas the night before Kickoff, and all through the shop,
Not a robot was moving, not even a drop
Of oil on the floor; tools were put away tight,
For the game reveal coming tomorrow at light.
Hoodies were worn and laptops stood near,
As dreams of new challenges filled us with cheer.
Would robots shoot high? Would they balance or climb?
We’d know all the answers in just a short time.
So we closed up the shop with a buzz of delight,
Happy Kickoff to all—and to all a good night!

It's less than 24 hours until we find out if Rebuilt will be Recycle Rush 2.0. We are all excited and I'm happy to bring back the daily recap again for 2026. This channel will be used to post recaps of each meeting so that we keep a record of what we worked on and keep everyone in the loop in case of missed meetings. 
This past week, we went over the rules again for this upcoming season and went over the goals we have as a team and for each subteam as well. 
Hope everyone is excited and ready for a new build season!
