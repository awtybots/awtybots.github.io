Today was a good day. 2 of the 3 subsystems are “mounted” to the frame and Goldfire is all coming together now. We should be able to wire it up and run it tomorrow to get some testing done.

# Intake

- The intake made some more progress today and should be done pretty quickly tomorrow morning. 

# Shooter

- THE SHOOTER SHOOTS!!! Finally after 4 weeks, we got the shooter running. We are now ready to start seriously tuning the PID on the actual robot.

# Twindexer

- The updated compression works very well. Next steps will be to see how it works with the shooter. We should be able to test that out tomorrow once the shooter gets mounted fully.

Tomorrow should be exciting!!
