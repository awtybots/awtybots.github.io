Day 6
We got 1 prototype running today and it was one that wasn’t even on our list of options. We noticed some teams testing “spindexer” style hoppers, similar to ones from 2017 and figured we’d try to make one ourselves. It showed some good signs but we aren’t sure if the trade off is worth the cut into hopper size. Tomorrow or Saturday we hope to test out the roller style hopper similar to what CranBerry Alarm Ri3D and 254 from 2017 have. 
Shooter
The shooter was the other prototype we were hoping to test out today but we ran into some hiccups in the building of it. We got around 90% of the way done with it but we will have to redo it tomorrow as the shooter motors don’t mount correctly. 
Drivebase
The drive moved today and the field relative is working correctly. We had some issues with sparkmaxes not reading the motor sensors correctly to the point where we swapped a Neo550 and 3 sparkmaxes before we just grabbed a brand new one and put that on. Programming should now be able to take the robot to start working on some auto PID for Pathplanner and hopefully work on some subsystems by the end of Saturday.
