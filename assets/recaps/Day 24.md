It’s the start of week 4 and fabrication and production is about to kick into high gear. Today we started with prototyping a change in the twindexer. We wanted to switch from 6 inch to 4 inch wheels to see if we could save some space in the robot for other subsystems. So far from our tests, the 4 inch wheel should work. We just have to adjust the compression a bit and it should be good.

# Shooter

- We disassembled the old shooter with the adjustable hood to build the new one without the hood. The plates were cut during the meeting and we started getting shafts, pulleys and belts to assemble. 

# CAD

- We finalized the CAD last night of our robot but we still have work that needs to be done. We are in the fine tuning process now where we make sure we have the right belts, gears and pulleys and gather those items to place (hopefully) our last order of the season. 

We still are on track to finish the practice robot by Saturday (if our parts get ordered soon and delivered in time) so we can start full system testing. We created an order document to help keep us organized on the parts we need for each subsystem. This should help us make sure we have the right things and know if they are currently being made or ordered.
