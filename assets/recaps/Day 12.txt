Day 12
We got back to working on prototypes today. We updated our hopper to use rollers instead of belts. We don’t actually have any rollers due to our initial inventory of VEXPro rollers finally getting used up. There’s a bit of a hold up with ordering from school that I will look into tomorrow as that has our roller order in it. Instead, we scavenged for all the 2 inch wheels we could find at school and managed to makeshift a “roller” system similar to 254-2017. This took the whole meeting to break down our old hopper, cut new plates and get the shafts ready. In the end, it looks very promising. We ran it with around 10-12 balls and they indexed very quickly. The next test will be with a bigger hopper. We also want to get our intake rollers back on and get everything connected again so we can mount it onto the drive base. We have a long meeting tomorrow so that might be when we can get that done.
The shooter is making some progress. On the CAD side, we are working out the geometry of the double shooter and a hood while on the programming side, we’re trying to figure out PID. Hopefully we can get it learned quickly so we can start working on other things regarding the shooter.
