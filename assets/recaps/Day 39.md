# 23 Days Until McAllen

We had a packed house tonight to work on the robot. I had a rough and busy day so that delayed some parts getting worked on.

# Intake

- The linear slide parts were cut and some of the spacers were printed. We should be able to assemble it tomorrow and get it on the practice robot.

# Twindexer

- We are trying to run PID to control the current so that is still a work in progress. We also removed the finger wheels and that increased our indexing majorly. We found some jamming issues and are working to resolve that with the update on the competition robot.

# Vision

- Programming started working on vision and hope to have some progress done by the end of the week.

We also started working on the new battery cart. We hope to get that finished soon as well.
