Day 4
Today was more of a prep day. We finished the swerve modules and assembled the base of the practice robot. Tomorrow, programming should be able to configure all of the motors and test some basic driving. 
Programming
Programming team started working on the repo and laying out what subsystems they want to work on/will need for the robot. They should be able to get the practice robot drive base up and running quickly once electrical work is finished.
CAD
CAD started working on the Climber and a little bit on our wooden hopper/intake frame. The goal is to have a shooter and hooper/intake ready to be built/tested on Saturday. This will allow us to get a good idea of how our ideas can work together before we finalize any decisions.
