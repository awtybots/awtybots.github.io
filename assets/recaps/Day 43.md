# 19 days until McAllen

We had a big turn out today and completed some of our objectives. We didn’t make our goal of finishing the competition robot but we are close and should finish it early in the week.

# Intake

- We made some changes to the update but getting it installed took a little longer than expected. We aren’t sure those changes will work but we will make sure to test them out first thing on Monday. We don’t want to rush this as this is a very important part of the robot.

# Competition robot \- 50% done

- We finished the shooter and installed it to the brainpan. Outside of that, we are still waiting on the intake and climber to be finished. We had to adjust the climber so that took some time today to redo. We did add our limelight/swever cover mounts to the robot.

We also spent some time watching the Week 0 live stream and this game is looking like it’s going to be super fun. Defense will be a big difference as well in these early weeks as teams figure out the game. It’s going to be super exciting to play and watch this game this year\!
