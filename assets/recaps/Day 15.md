Unfortunately, we cut our late meeting short. Weather forecasts changed
overnight and we didn't want to risk any unsafe conditions. We still met
and got work done today.

# Hopper 

- We rotated the hopper based on what CAD stated where they wanted
things to be placed. We found an issue with the rollers hitting our
swerve module motors. We made a quick fix but we'll want to look into a
more permanent solution in the future.

# Shooter 

- The shooter got fully assembled....but it doesn't work. There's
a lot of friction and resistance. We will need to go over the design and
see if there is a way to fix it so that we can come in on Tuesday with a
game plan to fix

# Programming 

- The programming team worked on getting PID for auto working
and tuned and made some progress. Hopefully we can start working on some
basic auto routines with just the drive base next week.

- Unfortunately, we were not able to get all the subsystems working
together today. Hopefully we can achieve that
