\- 21 Days Until McAllen

We had a long meeting today and we did get things done.

# Intake 

- The intake took the whole meeting again to assemble and get on the robot (not a good sign for repairability) but once it got on, we were able to run it and test it. The actuation finally worked and the rollers also worked too. We do want to find a way to speed up the rollers to intake the fuel consistently but we think that’s more of a gearing issue which shouldn’t be too hard to solve. We’re just happen to finally have an intake that we can start iterating on and putting it through the paces.

# Competition robot \- 30% done

- We put the pulleys, belts, cone and wheels on the comp robot for the twindexer so it is officially the first subsystem that has been completed on the competition robot. The shooter plates were cut but we are waiting on 3D printed parts to finish to fully assemble that.
