Day 34

Today was all about minor adjustments to solve problems. We had some good successes today.

Twindexer

We adjusted the wall of the twindexer by adding 1/8 spacers to all the bolts on the 3DP printed walls. The change worked and the balls fell in smoother. We might add an additional 1/16 for good measure but for now, it’s good. The next test will be to see if the twindexer can run with a full hopper of balls to the shooter. The other motor pulley shredded so we are printing new ones at 100% infill to hopefully solve that problem.

Shooter

We removed the PID from the kicker motor and that eliminated the jamming issues. We are still changing the shooter out because we want a sharper angle on our shots but it’s good to know that this shooter will work for now for some PID tuning and testing.

Intake

The intake is still struggling but we did find a possible solution. We removed the belts and were able to successfully run the intake so we now know that one of the belts is creating friction issues. We will address it tomorrow and hopefully be able to run the intake finally.

The pushing out of the intake is still an issue that we are addressing. We hope we can solve that tomorrow as well.

Climber

We swapped the climber around to the correct orientation and we still were unsuccessful with the climb but we haven’t made the changes we wanted to yet. We will probably work on that tomorrow and maybe try again either at the end of the meeting or on Saturday.
