# 22 Days Until McAllen

Programming was the main point today as we got a lot of things working that we’ve spent a lot of time looking into

# Programming

- We started by looking at voltage control on the kicker and Twindexer. I think we have a solution in place, but it’s not pulling as much current as it has been. It’s also possible that we were running on a good battery and other times, the battery was bad. We’ll want to test that some more in the future. We also got a basic pose estimation working and the robot successfully locked on to the hub and can strafe while keeping focus on the hub. The plan will be to add a few more cameras to help us always know where we are on the field. That then led to variable RPM for the shooter. It sounded like it was working but we are unable to fully test it as we have some low ceilings in our Makerspace. We’ll need to move it outside and get more accurate testing but it does look promising.

# Intake

- The intake was 98% finished by the end of the meeting. There were a lot of hiccups along the way that slowed the assembly down but it’s pretty much assembled. We will want to test it first thing tomorrow so we can finally get this monkey off of our back.

# Competition robot \- 25% done (correct percentage this time)

The competition robot got the brainpan mounted with majority of the twindexer parts added. We just need need to get the omni wheel system done and it should be good to go.
