# 20 Days Until McAllen

We made some great progress today on both the practice robot and competition robot.

# Practice robot

- We made some more adjustments to the intake and it’s working pretty well. We also attached the hopper walls and it looks like everything is working great. We are now working on minor upgrades so we can swap them on the practice robot and then be ready to put on the competition robot.

- The shooter got almost assembled and mounted. We should be able to finish it up tomorrow and even start some electrical work on it.

Saturday is shaping up to be a great day with some great progress.
