We had a really good day for CAD. A lot of decisions were made and we moved forward to having a complete robot. We should be on track to meet our CAD and build deadline (1 complete subsystem) by the end of this week.

Twindexer
V2 of the twindexer was assembled today and it was pretty good. According to the ball calculator, we hit 11.61 BPS (Balls per Second) with a max of 18. We think we can get the 11 number easy and already have some ideas to try out for the next iteration. The goal will be to get this mounted on the robot by the end of the meeting to set us up for Saturday.

Shooter
….no comment. 
In all seriousness, we did fix the tension issues with the kicker and split the shooter into two separately run shooters based on information we found from other teams who are also doing double shooters. HOPEFULLY we will have it finished tomorrow so we can finally get back to testing the shooter.
