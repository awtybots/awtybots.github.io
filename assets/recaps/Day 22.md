I don't have all the information from the day but let's start with our
middle schoolers

# Middle School VEXIQ 

- Middle school robotics had their last competition of
the season today and they performed super well. Out of 24 teams, 5829S
ranked 9th with an average point total of 135.17 and 5829A finished 12th
with an average point total of 110.17. These are both huge jumps from
when they first competed and had average point totals of 21.27 and 11.33
respectively. Only 5829S made the playoffs and finished 5th with a score
of 92. The last regular match was them playing together. Sadly, the
score wasn't the greatest but they had a lot of fun.

# Shooter 

- The shooter got done but unfortunately, we ran into a lot of
issues. After talking about those issues and looking at fixes, we
decided to go the route that Spectrum has shared of not having an
adjustable hood and just having a fixed one. We can get multiple shots
by adjusting the RPM based on distance and that minimizes the issues we
would have with the hood.

# Hopper 

- The spindexer had some work done on it as well and we are looking
to get it mounted to the drivebase next week.

# Programming

- The drivebase was swapped to a brainpan and the programming
team got it back to keep working on the drive. They are still having
some issues but we think it will be worked out quickly by Monday.

# Goals for the Week 

- We want to have a fully functioning practice robot by
Saturday. That's going to require a lot of work from everyone to get
there but with the CAD being finalized tomorrow, we should be able to
come in and cut parts Monday and start assembly after school (fingers
crossed). We think this goal is achievable and will set us up greatly
going into our winter break the following week.
