Day 26
Today was a messy day, but in a good way. We started building the practice robot.
Drive
The programming team managed to fix the drifting issues with the drive. They are ready to start tuning autos, but we took the drive base away from them because we started building the practice robot. We could have just used new swerve modules but we hopefully should just finish everything by this Saturday so they can have a complete robot by then.
Shooter
We made some progress on finishing the shooter to the point where I’m pretty confident it will be finished tomorrow either during school or early in the meeting. (excuse the base of the off-season robot. It was scrapped for some parts.)
Intake
The intake started assembly today. We learned how challenging it can be to put the silicone tubing on to the rollers but we managed to get that done pretty quickly. This 4-bar will be a challenge to assemble but we think it will work great once it’s done.
Spindexer/Brainpan
The twindexer is now incorporated into the brainpan so we started the mounting of that. It took a while because we had to take our wooden base off with the electronics to then mount the plastic one. We also wanted to make some support braces so we cut those and should get them added tomorrow.
It was a good day with everyone being involved and working hard. We think because of that, we’ll definitely achieve our goal by this weekend.
