Day 13
Tonight was the first night of our late night meetings. We made a lot of progress on several fronts. 
Hopper
We started with getting a divider made into our hopper so we can start funneling balls into our double shooter. That part worked pretty ok, but we found an issue with one of the motors and gearboxes as our bottom rollers aren’t running at the same speed as our top rollers which causes a little jamming. We’ll need to replace that motor and/or gearbox tomorrow. 
We also mounted the hopper to the drive base so we could start driving and intaking. Overall the intake worked pretty well. It’s still a wooden prototype so there were some issues with shafts and things falling out but we picked up every ball until things started falling apart under stress. With balls in the hopper in our current configuration, we are noticing that they get stuck at the entrance above the intake. We know this will be solved with the agitation we are planning but we also will probably want to reduce the angle of our rollers and maybe add a few more going towards the front in place of the ramp. This is one of the systems we feel the most confident in so we might start making progress heading toward final iteration.
Shooter
Double shooter plates got cut….but we forgot about how we plan to mount them to the robot. That will be the challenge tomorrow as we try to assemble it and hopefully mount it onto the robot. 
Shooter PID made some progress as we were able to shoot 15/16 fuel consistently. We’ll focus on fine tuning that and getting the rate of fire up as well.
