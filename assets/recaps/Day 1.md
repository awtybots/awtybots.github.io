- Rebuilt was officially revealed and the game looks really fun! We have
our first ball shooting game since 2022 and our first big obstacle game
since 2016. The cool twist this year is you can't score all the time.
The scoring is broken into halves and Auto determines who scores first.
I think this element is very unique and really forces you to strategize
with what you do with your Inactive period. This is also the first time
in a long time where there is no bonus to scoring in auto point wise.
You also can climb for the first time ever in auto and teleop. This will
really force us to think about all phases of the game. After watching
the game and going over the rule book, we broke the robot elements into
3 major categories: Trench height, Shooter Ecosystem (includes shooter,
intake and hooper) and Climb. From there, we assigned weight points to
each one as to how we viewed them in importance. Out of 30, we assigned
22 to the Shooter Ecosystem, 3 to the Trench Height and 5 to the Climb.
We ended the meeting breaking into groups and doing research on climbs,
shooters and intakes so we can start prototyping ideas this week on
Monday. Monday we will start narrowing our ideas down so we can start
designing some prototypes to finish our design by the 20th of January.
