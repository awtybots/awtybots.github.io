Another no picture day today as we focused on making adjustments and changes.

# Intake

- We removed the intake and the motor and motor plates to make some changes to the motors. We tried to run the intake roller motors first thing today but they were not strong enough to intake the fuel. We also wanted to change the actuation motor gear ratio from 5:1 to 45:1. It didn’t make it back to the robot but it should first thing at tomorrow’s meeting.

# Shooter

- We removed the shooter to install the new shooter plates with our 3D printed ramp. So far it looks like it will be an improvement as the kicker wheels move a lot more freely than on the last version. This version also is a lot lighter than our previous one though we don’t think weight was going to be a big issue. 

We are hoping to get this all finished up tomorrow so we can meet our deadline of our **practice robot being finished**. We have changes already lined up that we want to make for the competition robot.
