It was a slower day today (Wednesdays look to be our slow days this year) as today was mainly focused on CADing and getting the practice drivebase up and running. With the lower turnout, all we got done was updating the firmwares on the motors and downloading the 2026 files to update the rio firmware. We also hard mounted the electronics and cleaned up some wiring.

The goal for tomorrow will be to hopefully get the robot moving and maybe start cutting some wood prototypes.
