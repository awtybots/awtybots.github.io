Today was a slow day. Wednesdays tend to be our slower days but we still
got some work done.

Part Order 2 of 4 Arrived Our REV order arrived with motors, angle
brackets and EasySwerve modules. The motors will be used for our
competition robot and the EasySwerve modules unfortunately will be used
in the offseason or next season. We thought we would use them this year
but with the geometry of the bump, we didn't want to risk hitting our
motors repeatedly throughout the season. Speaking of bumps....

# Bumpers 

- The foam was cut and installed on the bumpers for this year.
Fingers crossed we don't change any robot designs from here on out. This
was the easiest bumpers we've had to do in a long time. Granted we
haven't worked on the fabric part yet, but we are pretty confident this
year that bumpers will not be a last minute task like they have been in
previous years.

# Twindexer 

The twindexer got a V2 update with some minor changes. We were
unable to get it running before we left but we will try to work on that
tomorrow. We're still tuning and trying to find the right setup to work
things out.

# Shooter 

- Shooter is still getting worked on. It's taking awhile to
assemble which is teaching us about designing for easy to assemble
parts. We're also noticing some friction/tension issues with the kicker
part of the shooter. We'll investigate it tomorrow when the shooter is
mostly assembled.

# CAD 

- CAD is hard at work so far with our deadline coming up. Huge props
to them for being able to pivot so quickly on ideas and designs. We are
still on track to finish by our deadline. This season has been moving
rapidly but I do feel like we've been keeping up while also not making
any rash decisions. (others might disagree....)
