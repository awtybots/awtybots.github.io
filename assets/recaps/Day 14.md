Night 2 of our late night meetings was a slower one, but still pretty productive. 

# Shooter
- We shot the shooter with new PID values into the hub and things look more promising. Still some more fine tuning is needed but we’re making progress. We also disassembled the wooden shooter and started assembly of our V1 double shooter out of polycarb. We ended it the night there with a little more work to go for tomorrow. We’re short on 2 inch wheels so this one is going to be tight. We should be able to make this work though.

# Hopper
- We fixed our bottom roller motor by upping the gear ratio from 3:1 to 5:1. The hopper ran better but the balls are still kinda struggling coming out. We’ll want to address this as rate of fire is key to our success

A winter storm is coming in tomorrow evening and we have planned for a 3rd late night meeting. We might end early to make sure everyone gets home safely.
